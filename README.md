# Children Health Indicators in Kenyan Counties
# Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis, CEMA Project
In this project, I analyze a dataset containing monthly data for children under 5 years of age, disaggregated at a county level for the period January 2021 to June 2023 in Kenya. The dataset provides valuable information on various health indicators, including the total number of children dewormed, the number of children with acute malnutrition, the number of stunted children in different age groups, the number of children with diarrhea cases, and the number of underweight children in different age categories.

# Research Question:
The primary research question I aim to explore in this analysis is: **"Is there a relationship between the count of children dewormed and various health indicators across different counties in Kenya?"** This question seeks to investigate potential associations between deworming efforts and health indicators such as acute malnutrition, stunting, diarrhea, and underweight cases within different age groups.

# Methodology:
To address the research question, I start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution, patterns, and relationships among the variables. The EDA will involve data visualization using scatter plots, bar plots, and other graphical representations.

Next, I calculate the correlation matrix to assess the strength and direction of associations between the count of children dewormed and other health indicators. This analysis will provide valuable insights into potential relationships between the variables.

Finally, I conduct appropriate statistical analyses, such as regression models or other relevant methods, to further explore and quantify the relationships between deworming efforts and the selected health indicators.

# Repository Contents:
1. Data/: Contains the dataset in CSV format, providing the necessary information for analysis.

2. RScript/: Contains the R script for data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling.

3. README.md: Provides an overview of the project, research question, methodology, and repository contents.

4. Results/: Contains the outputs of the data analysis, such as visualizations and summary statistics.

# Conclusion:
By conducting in-depth data analysis and exploring potential relationships between deworming efforts and health indicators, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of deworming programs and their impact on children's health in different Kenyan counties. The findings from this study can help inform policymakers and healthcare practitioners in designing and implementing targeted interventions to improve children's health outcomes.
