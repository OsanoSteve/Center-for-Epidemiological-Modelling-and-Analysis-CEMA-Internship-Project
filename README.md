# Project Name: Children Health Indicators in Kenyan Counties
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing monthly data for children under 5 years of age, disaggregated at a county level for the period January 2021 to June 2023 in Kenya. The dataset provides valuable information on various health indicators, including the total number of children dewormed, the number of children with acute malnutrition, the number of stunted children in different age groups, the number of children with diarrhea cases, and the number of underweight children in different age categories.
